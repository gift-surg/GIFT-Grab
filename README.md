# GIFT-Grab

GIFT-Grab is an open-source C++ and Python API for acquiring, processing and encoding video streams in real time.

GIFT-Grab supports several frame-grabber cards, standard-compliant network streams and video files.

The Python API is compatible with [NumPy][numpy] and [SciPy][scipy].
Please note that currently **only Python 2** is supported.

[numpy]: http://www.numpy.org/


## Features

* Capturing video streams using frame-grabber hardware, the following cards are supported:
   - [Epiphan DVI2PCIe Duo][e-dd]
   - [Blackmagic DeckLink SDI 4K][bm-models]
   - [Blackmagic DeckLink 4K Extreme 12G][bm-models]
* Capturing standard-compliant network video streams
* Reading (decoding) video files
* Writing (encoding) video files (including real-time encoding), the following formats are supported:
   - [Xvid][xvid]-encoded [AVI][avi]
   - [HEVC (H.265)][hevc]-encoded [MP4][mp4]
   - [VP9][vp9]-encoded [WebM][webm]
* Exposing video data as NumPy arrays for processing with NumPy-compatible Python libraries


## Getting started

* Operating system
   - GIFT-Grab has been extensively tested on Ubuntu Linux.
   - Windows compatibility is experimental. Please see the [`experimental-windows` branch][windows].
* Installation
   - [Required tools and libraries][gg-reqs] and [guidelines for installing them][gg-tips]
   - [Building GIFT-Grab from source][build-from-source] (C++ and Python)
   - [Installing GIFT-Grab using `pip`][pip] (only Python)
* [Python examples with explanation][rtd]
* [Building a minimal GIFT-Grab with NumPy compatibility][gg-min]
* API documentation
   - [C++ API documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/gift-surg/GIFT-Grab/)
   - Python API documentation: please use the C++ API documentation
      * Most Python API elements are equivalent to their C++ counterparts.
      * Differences are noted in the C++ docstrings (e.g. [`data()` method of `VideoFrame`][vf-data]).
* [Known issues and limitations][gg-issues]
